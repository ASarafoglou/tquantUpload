The Assumption of Local Stochastic Independence 

This app exemplifies the local independence assumption of the basic local
independence model (BLIM). This assumption is used to calculate the
probability P(R|K) of a response pattern R given the knowledge state K. First
the user learns the empirical interpretation of the model parameters. Next, an
example with five items demonstrates the difference between correct responses
and mastered items. After assigning to each item its correct interpretation,
the corresponding part of the formula for P(R|K) is displayed. Finally, the
app illustrates how P(R|K) changes with different parameter values.
