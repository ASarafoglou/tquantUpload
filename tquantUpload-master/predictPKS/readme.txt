Classical and Bayesian Parameter Estimation
Author: Alexandra Sarafoglou

This app demonstrates classical and Bayesian parameter estimation methods for

probabilistic knowledge structures. You are be able to

make changes to the observed response frequencies and the parameters of a

basic local independence model (BLIM), which are the probabilities to make
a careless error or a lucky guess. This app allows you to estimate the

model parameters using different estimation methods (classical and Bayesian),

visualize the results, and compare the methods with each other.
