Identifiability of a Basic Local Independence Model

This app visualizes the trade-off between the parameters of a non-identifiable
basic local independence model (BLIM). The user can manipulate the values of
two parameters which are involved in a trade-off, displayed by the
indifference curve. The predicted response frequencies remain constant. The
example shown in the app directly refers to the presentation 'Probabilistic
Knowledge Structures II' (Heller and Wickelmaier, pp. 19-22).
