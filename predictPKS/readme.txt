Classical and Bayesian Parameter Estimation

This app demonstrates classical and Bayesian parameter estimation methods for
probabilistic knowledge structures. First, we will cover the most important
theoretical aspects of the estimation procedures. Then, you will be able to
make changes to the observed response frequencies and the parameters of a
basic local independence model (BLIM). This app allows you to estimate the
model parameters using different estimation methods (classical and Bayesian),
visualize the results, and compare the methods with each other.

Work in progress.
